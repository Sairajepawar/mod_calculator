## Introduction

Welcome to the Mod Calculator project! This web application is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases the concepts of throttling and debouncing to enhance user experience and optimize performance.


## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Modulo operation functionality.
- Throttling and debouncing implementation for improved performance and user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sairajepawar/mod-calculator.git
```

2. Open the project folder:

```bash
cd mod-calculator
```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter two numbers in the input fields.
2. And result will be automatically updated.

### Throttling and Debouncing

- **Throttling:** The calculator uses throttling to limit the frequency of function execution, ensuring that calculations are performed at a steady rate. This prevents the calculator from being overwhelmed with rapid user input.

- **Debouncing:** Input values are debounced, delaying the calculation until a pause in user input. This reduces unnecessary computations and enhances the overall performance of the calculator.
